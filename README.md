## üöÄ Quick Start & Deployment

### 1. Prerequisites

- **Python 3.11+** installed on your local machine.
- A **Telegram Account** to get API credentials.
- A **second Telegram Account** to act as the music assistant.
- A **Bot Token** from [@BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather).

### 2. Get API Credentials

1.  Go to [my.telegram.org](https://my.telegram.org) and log in with your primary Telegram account.
2.  Navigate to **API development tools**.
3.  Create a new application (you can name it anything).
4.  Copy and save your `API_ID` and `API_HASH`.

### 3. Create a Bot on Telegram

1.  Open Telegram and message [@BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather).
2.  Send `/newbot` and follow the instructions to create your bot.
3.  Copy and save the `BOT_TOKEN` provided.
4.  **(Recommended)** Set a profile picture and description for your bot using `/setuserpic` and `/setdescription`.
5.  **(Important)** Disable group privacy mode to allow the bot to read messages in groups:
    - Send `/mybots` to @BotFather.
    - Select your bot.
    - Go to **Bot Settings** -> **Group Privacy** -> **Turn off**.

### 4. Generate Session String

The bot uses a second Telegram account (the "assistant") to stream audio. You need to generate a `SESSION_STRING` for this account.

1.  Clone this repository to your local machine:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/YourRepoName.git
    cd YourRepoName
    ```
2.  Install the necessary dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install pyrogram TgCrypto
    ```
3.  Run the session generator script:
    ```bash
    python generate_session.py
    ```
4.  Follow the prompts:
    -   Enter the `API_ID` and `API_HASH` you got in Step 2.
    -   Enter the **phone number of your assistant account**.
    -   Enter the login code sent to that account.
    -   If you have 2FA enabled, enter your password.
5.  Copy the generated `SESSION_STRING` and save it securely.

### 5. Configuration

1.  Create a file named `.env` in the root of the project.
2.  Copy the contents of `.env.example` into it.
3.  Fill in the values with your credentials:

    ```env
    # From my.telegram.org
    API_ID=...
    API_HASH=...

    # From @BotFather
    BOT_TOKEN=...

    # From generate_session.py
    SESSION_STRING=...

    # The username of your assistant account (without @)
    ASSISTANT_USERNAME=...
    ```
